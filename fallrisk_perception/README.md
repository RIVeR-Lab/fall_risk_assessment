2.Using OpenCV in a ROS node

This article can give you a idea about how it works:

But it is out of dated and using the old rosbuild rather than catkin. 

If you still want to follow this article, make sure to make adjustments.

For example, the tutorial gives:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-camera-umd
```

Then you need to change it to:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-camera-umd
```
